    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) rely on distances between sample and center to determine if the sample should be assigned to the cluster. A commonly used distance metric is the Euclidean distance. Below is a set of sensor feature values collected from a device. You are asked to compute the distance between the sample and cluster center to evaluate whether they should be assigned to the cluster. A sensor system recorded two data points with the following 3-dimensional feature vectors:  \n",
    "- Sample A: a=(2.0,3.5,1.0)\n",
    "- Sample B: b=(1.6,2.1,0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster center is: center=(1,2.5,1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:  \n",
    "- Calculate the Euclidean distance between a and center, also b and center.\n",
    "- Given that the current clustering radius is r = 2.0, if the distance is less than r, then it will be assigned to the center. Determine whether these samples would be assigned to the cluster."

    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "In natural language processing, word vectors are commonly used to represent the semantic meaning of words. To compare the similarity between two words, we often calculate the cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between their corresponding vectors. This is typically done using the dot product, as cosine similarity is defined as:cos‚Å°(Œ∏)=(u.v)/‚Äñu‚Äñ‚Äñv‚Äñ . A higher cosine similarity indicates greater semantic similarity between the two words.  \n",
